# securitizeTest

 - Yarn
 - Async/Await
 - Typescript + Express
 - Axios
 - React Bootstrap
 - Eslint / Prettier
 - Dotenv

1. Client side: 

  ``yarn install``
  
  ``yarn start``
  
2. Server side:

  Check you set up .env file with .env.example variables
  
  ``yarn``
  
  ``yarn run watch``
  
  
Things that can be improved:

We can use Material UI for styling.
We can make components for each card
Leave commented code in a PR is not a good practice. But I left that controller because we have another endpoint to get Dollar Rate in same API.
